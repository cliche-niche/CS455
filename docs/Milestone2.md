Functionalities completed:
+ Firstly, the app can be exited by pressing `Ctrl-C`, where it prompts the user if there are any unsaved changes. `Ctrl-Q` can instead be used for copying text, `Ctrl-X` for cutting text, and `Ctrl-V` for pasting text. <br>
+ `F1` can be pressed at any time to print the `help` function.
+ `Ctrl-Z`/`Ctrl-Y` can be used for Undo/Redo respectively.
+ Support for directory structure has also been implemented.
+ Basic navigation and selection using cursor and arrow keys has also been implemented.
+ Some advanced navigation has also been supported using `Ctrl`+arrow keys, `home`, `end`, `pg up`, `pg dn`, etc.
+ Scrolling using mouse is also supported.

Progress in some functionalities:
+ Autosave has been implemented, though it has not been fully integrated yet.
+ Highlighting some specific keywords - some issues like concurrent scrolling in preview remain.
+ Line numbers next to lines - issues like concurrent scrolling remain to be fixed.

The issues on the github repository have also been updated with their progress.
