This repository contains a (CLI) text editor made for the course CS455A (2023-24 I Sem.). Each milestone has a corresponding `.md` file in the [docs](./docs/) directory. Regardless, a brief description of each milestone has been provided below:

+ [Milestone 1](./docs/Milestone1.md): Outlining and elaborating on Requirements and Timelines for the project. With a team of 4 - Abhishek ["abhishekshree"](https://github.com/abhishekshree) Shree, Aditya ["cliche-niche"](https://github.com/cliche-niche) Tanwar, Janhvi ["Janhvi-Rochwani"](https://github.com/Janhvi-Rochwani) Rochwani, Parinay ["parinayc20"](https://github.com/parinayc20) Chauhan - the project is divided into 5 milestones <i>(not to be confused with the milestones of the course)</i>, each taking roughly 28 human hours.
+ [Milestone 2](./docs/Milestone2.md): Implement some of the functionalities mentioned in the project milestone and build a working example. The project requires at least `1.21.x` version of `Go`, and can be run using the following commands:
```bash
go build main.go
./main -location="."
```
Please ensure you have `Go` installed. <br>
The executable can be run the with a command-line argument `location`, where the location of a directory or a file can be given. If this argument is omitted, the application opens with its current directory. <br>
Most of the basic functionalities have been implemented in this version. The exact progress has been elaborated in the [Milestone 2](./docs/Milestone2.md) file.
